dodpdx - acceptances
====================


Simple script for sending acceptance emails.

This isn't really that useful to anyone who doesn't want to get thier hands dirty, but it serves as a good launching off point for anyone trying to do something similar. I struggled the most with encoding issues, jinja, and smtp settings, all of which are handled in this script. I hpoe you find this useful.

It was built to process the csv output of a busyconf schedule export.
